## Version History

- **v2.0.0** - Major feature release with recording, enhanced detection, and modular architecture
- **v1.0.0** - Initial release with basic terminal control and screenshot functionality

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

1. **Update dependencies** - New Python packages may be required
2. **Check configuration** - New environment variables available
3. **Review commands** - New recording commands available (`/rec`, `/rc`)
4. **Test completion detection** - Enhanced system may behave differently
5. **Verify recording** - New 20-minute rolling buffer system

### Breaking Changes
- None - All changes are backward compatible
- Enhanced features are additive and don't break existing functionality

### New Requirements
- **ffmpeg** - Required for video recording functionality
- **Additional Python packages** - See `requirements.txt` for updates
